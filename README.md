# CApitalization Correction

This extension corrects two types of capitalization typos:
1. If you type two uppercase characters followed by a lowercase character, it will change the second character to lowercase. For example, if you type "THe", it will be changed to "The".
2. If you type a lowercase word followed by an apostrophe and an uppercase letter, it will change the uppercase letter to lowercase. For example, "don'T" will be changed to "don't".

# Configuration

In the settings you can enable the correction for certain file extensions.
It defaults to markdown and text files, but you can add any file extensions.

Furthermore "CApitalization Correction" is aware of C-style comments, i.e.: //, /* */.
If you include a specific file extension, only the text inside the comments will be corrected.
